# 50-projects-in-50-days
Another Udemy Course to sharpen my CSS & Javascript Skills

The intial course was simply 50 quick projects over 50 days, which I completed. However the same instructor had an addtional course for 20 Web Projects with Vanillia JavaScript. Its kind of almost a continuation of the 50 projects, but the addtional 20 are longer. So I will be putting them in the same repo.
